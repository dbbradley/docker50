                        This is CS50!
                      Powered by Cloud9

Welcome to the CS50 IDE Beta! Below are a list of features and some tips and
tricks for usage and getting started. The end of the document describes how 
to file bug reports if you come across problems.

# Features

* Fully-featured IDE with syntax highlighting and word completion for C and
  other languages.

* An embedded terminal window, below, that provides you with command-line
  access to your very own Ubuntu instance, much like the CS50 Appliance, but
  in the cloud! (try typing `ls`!)

* File browser at left, which lets you navigate the files and folders in
  your workspace (without using `cd` and `ls`).

* A graphical interface to `gdb`! To debug a program you're working on,
  click the `Debug` button up top.

# Getting Started

## Files

* Create a new C file by clicking **File > New File** and then begin coding. 
  Save the file with **File > Save As...** and make sure the file name ends in 
  `.c`.

* Download individual files by right-clicking their name and select 
  **Download**.

* Download all the files in the workspace with **File > Download Project**.

* Upload files by selecting **File > Upload Local Files...**.

## Set up Dropbox

Normally, all of the files in your workspace reside solely in the cloud-based 
Ubuntu instance. Accessing them outside of the CS50 IDE therefore requires 
downloading the files onto your local machine. Enabling Dropbox allows file
syncing between the CS50 IDE and your local computer without manual 
intervention. Performing the below steps will begin syncing your workspace 
directory with a folder in Dropbox so you could easily backup, modify, add, or 
remove files from your workspace directly from your Dropbox account.

Setting it up is easy:

1. Install Dropbox. In the terminal window below, type `dropbox50`

2. This will provide a link to a Dropbox page which will authorize Dropbox in
   the CS50 IDE to access your account. Copy-paste this link to a new browser
   tab and follow the instructions. If you don't yet have account, it will give
   you an option to create one.

3. Once the computer is linked to Dropbox, the install command will say:
   `This computer is now linked to Dropbox. Welcome, <username>` and will
   continue with the installation. The remaining steps take several minutes,
   please be patient!

    * By default, the setup will exclude all folders except a `CS50 IDE`
      folder inside of Dropbox to reduce the chance that your workspace runs
      out of disk space.

4. After a few moments, your workspace will be synced in a
   `CS50 IDE/<workspace_name>` directory in Dropbox!

5. There are other `dropbox` commands, as well. Run `dropbox --help` to
   see them.

## Compiling and Running

* Click on the `Debug` button above. Your source code will automatically be 
  compiled and run.

    * Your program's input and output (including any errors during compilation) 
      occur in a new tab in the Console panel, below.

    * You can only `Debug` one program at a time, so please quit a running
      program before trying to run `Debug` on another!

* The `Debug` option will open a GUI-based debugger panel on the right side
  of the workspace. You can view the stack, step through the code, and
  manipulate variables in this interface.

* Add breakpoints by clicking in the space directly to the left of a line
  number. A red dot will appear, which annotates the breakpoint.

## Problem Sets

To begin work on your problem set, simply follow the instructions on the
specification from the beginning. **Please note that for the time being,
`update50` will not work, but you can safely ignore that error for now!**

If you have set up Dropbox in your workspace, any files that are present in
your `~/workspace/` directory are automatically synced to Dropbox in the
`CS50 IDE/<workspace_name>` directory.

## More comfortable

If you wish to enable more advanced features of the CS50 IDE, disable the
`Less Comfortable` mode by unchecking that option in the `View` menu.
